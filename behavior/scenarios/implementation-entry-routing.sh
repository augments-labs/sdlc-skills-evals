# Behavioural scenario: does routing hold at the IMPLEMENTATION ENTRY boundary?
#
# Scope, so the name does not overclaim: this judges exactly one boundary — the
# moment code is first written. It does not judge the done boundary or the
# integration boundary. Those need a fixture that actually reaches them; this
# one is a bug report with no ship intent, so a correct agent never gets there.
# Everything else the run does is PRINTED for reading, never gated.
#
# The failure it guards was observed, not imagined: in a real session on this
# repository the agent read a task, skipped routing entirely, and went straight
# to editing. A PreToolUse hook caught it — real enforcement, but it existed
# because the session-start injection was a ~90-token POINTER asking for a
# discretionary tool call, and a discretionary call gets skipped.
#
# The verdict is ORDERING, read from the event stream, not from prose: both
# `test-driven-development` and `yagni` must appear as Skill invocations BEFORE
# the first Write/Edit on a code path. An agent that says it will use TDD and
# then edits first fails here, which is the whole point.
#
# This is a mandatory ordering property. Every valid run must pass; repetition
# supplies more observations, never a pass-rate allowance.

Fix it.

genuinely undetermined, record the assumption and carry on to a complete change.
