# Behavioural scenario: does a repo edit start in an owned, ignored git
# worktree — or on the shared checkout the user is standing in?
#
# The failure this guards was observed on this opening, not imagined: with the
# previous skill and router installed, the RED arm loaded `test-driven-development`
# and `yagni`, never the workspace skill, and edited on `dev` in place — no
# worktree, no branch. The rewrite makes the procedure executable — detect,
# choose `.worktrees/`, prove it is ignored, create from the base — and names
# the skill first in the router's edit example. This run checks the ARTIFACT
# that procedure leaves: the worktree, its ignore rule, and an untouched
# protected branch.
#
# Bound to one harness and to a tier below the default on purpose: a smaller
# model is where the discipline slips first and the run is cheap, and the
# assertions read the harness's own worktree list and event stream, which only
# the bound adapter has been checked to expose. Bind another adapter by
# verifying those two things there, not by loosening the list.
#
# The tier is medium, not small, because small was tried: on this adapter two
# GREEN runs on the small tier loaded no skill at all — not this one, not the
# router — so a run there measures whether the small tier activates skills,
# which is a different question with a different owner. Pass `--tier small`
# to watch that instead.
#
# The fixture sits on `dev` — a protected name. On the runner's usual task
# branch the skill's own skip clause fires and there is nothing to observe.

`resolve()` in src/apikeys.js rejects a lowercase `bearer ` scheme, and one of
our SDKs sends it that way. Accept the scheme case-insensitively and keep the
suite green.
