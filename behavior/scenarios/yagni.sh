# The failure this catches: an agent that reads "build the minimum" and writes
# minimal-but-cryptic code — single-letter names, no why-comment, style foreign
# to the file — or, overcorrecting the other way, gold-plates a two-tier
# discount into a rules engine. yagni holds BOTH: scope is minimised, craft
# and correctness never are.
#
# Asking the agent to *describe* that balance cannot catch it. So the checks are
# mechanical and hostile: a probe suite we inject proves the tiers actually work
# whatever shape the implementation took, greps prove the code is readable in
# the file's own idiom, and a dependency/file-count cap proves it stayed small.

Add volume discounting to the pricing module: orders of 100 units or more get
8% off the line total, orders of 500 units or more get 15% off. Apply the
discount inside `orderTotal()` in `src/pricing.js` — callers should not have to
know the tiers exist. Round to integer cents; we charge whole cents only.

Keep the suite green when you're done.
