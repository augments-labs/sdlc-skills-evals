# One file: the fixture, the opening, and the assertions. Sourced by any
# adapter's run-behavioral.sh, which supplies the harness plumbing.

# What this proves that an activation test cannot: `spec-it` says a behavioural
# requirement's acceptance criterion should take an EXECUTABLE form, and that
# what you name must actually be built and RUN. A test that asks the agent to
# *describe* spec-it would pass an agent that recites it perfectly and still
# ships a spec promising verification it never wrote. This runs the skill and
# reads the artifact.
#
# Contract for a scenario file — define these three:
#   scenario_opening        prints the prompt (optionally scenario_opening_<adapter>)
#   scenario_setup   $1=dir seeds the fixture
#   scenario_assert  $1=dir asserts on the finished workdir; exit code is the verdict

We're adding per-API-key rate limiting to this billing API. Plan tiers get
different limits (free/pro/enterprise), and clients need to be able to tell how
much budget they have left.

Before anyone designs or builds it, I want the requirements spec: what it must
do, and how each requirement gets verified. Write it up.

# `codex exec` is single-turn: an opening that invites a clarifying question ends
# the run with NO deliverable — the first Codex arm died exactly that way, after
# routing correctly. Pre-empt the interview. Used for BOTH Codex arms, so RED vs
# GREEN stays a controlled comparison within that harness.

We're adding per-API-key rate limiting to this billing API. The limits are
settled product policy: free = 10 requests/minute, pro = 60/minute,
enterprise = 600/minute, each a fixed 60-second window per API key. Clients need
to be able to tell how much budget they have left.

Before anyone designs or builds it, I want the requirements spec: what it must
do, and how each requirement gets verified. Write it up.

This is a non-interactive run: do not ask me questions. Where something is
genuinely undetermined, record it as an assumption or open question in the spec
and carry on to a complete deliverable.
