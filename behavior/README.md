# tests/behavioral/

One file per scenario, run by `tests/run-behavioral.sh`. Each drives a real
coding-agent CLI against a disposable project and then reads **the artifact it
produced** — not what it said about the artifact.

That is the whole reason these exist. A test that asks an agent to describe a
skill passes whenever the agent can paraphrase; only reading the output catches a
skill described correctly and *applied* wrongly — a spec that promises "all
criteria are automated tests" and ships none, or ships them marked `todo` so the
suite can never go red.

## The arms

RED installs the complete library from a worktree at `--base`; GREEN installs
it from the working tree. This preserves the baseline source after committing
an edit, not deterministic model behavior. Compare the same relevant scenario
and fixed evaluator under matching conditions.

`--arm none` installs no skills and observes the bare agent. A passing sample
can narrow a failure claim, but cannot erase an observed failure or establish
that a skill is useless. Keep current contract gaps distinct from sampled
behavior. This interface does not remove one skill from an otherwise identical
library, so it does not isolate that skill's contribution.

Each arm prints total wall time and token usage when the adapter reports it.
The difference includes generated work and tool use, not just skill text. An
adapter without usage telemetry says so instead of printing zero. Report all
passes, failures, and inconclusive attempts; `docs/testing.md` owns interpretation.

## Writing one

A scenario is one file, `<skill>.sh`, defining three required functions and one
optional continuation function:

```bash
scenario_opening          # the user's first message, verbatim
scenario_followups        # optional: fills followups=(...) for one resumed session
scenario_setup   <dir>    # seed the disposable project
scenario_assert  <dir>    # read what was built; exit code IS the verdict
```

Three optional variables narrow a run, and each is declared in the scenario
rather than inferred: `scenario_branch` names the branch the fixture is seeded
on (default `task/behavioral-probe`; a scenario judging branch discipline needs a
protected name there or the skill's skip clause fires), `scenario_harnesses`
lists the adapters the assertions have been checked against (any other adapter
refuses the run), and `scenario_model_tier` asks for `small | medium | large`,
which the adapter binds to a model (`adapter_model`) — a small model is where a
discipline slips first, and the cheapest place to watch it.

A scenario with follow-up turns requires an adapter implementation of
`adapter_continue_behavioral`. Continuation must use the harness's structured
session identity; starting a fresh session and replaying prose is not equivalent.

**Make the exit code carry the verdict.** A written summary is produced by the
same agent that wants it green; an exit code is not. Assert what is easy to fake
and hard to see in a transcript: that an artifact exists, that it *loads*, and
that it can actually fail. The strongest assertions take something away and
require the gate to notice — gut the implementation and the test must go red;
restore the defect and the reproduction must go red.

**Ground the opening in the fixture.** An opening that presupposes something the
project does not contain scores the fixture, not the library: the agent correctly
answers that there is no such area and builds nothing, which is
indistinguishable from a skill that failed to change anything. `tests/fixtures.sh`
says what exists, and `assert.sh` holds the helpers every scenario shares.

**Scenarios are shared by every harness.** They were byte-identical across three
copies before this. A per-harness override exists only for a real constraint —
`codex exec` is single-turn, so a scenario that invites a clarifying question ends
that run with no deliverable, and `scenario_opening_codex()` pre-empts it. A
per-adapter `scenario_setup_<harness>()` override works the same way for fixtures.
Never use an override to make an arm look better, and say so when you use one.

## Admission is deliberately strict

A scenario is retained only for **a failure actually observed**, with a verdict
that can be checked mechanically. Not an imagined gap, and not a coverage push:
these are the most expensive tests in the repository, and one that was never
grounded in a real defect costs hours to run and proves nothing when it passes.

| Selection | API calls | Per call | Wall clock |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| One scenario, one harness, one arm | 1 | ~5–40 min | — |
| Every scenario × 3 harnesses × 2 arms | 16 × 3 × 2 | ~5–40 min | **8–60 h** |

That matrix is **deliberately not filled**, and the limit is stated rather than
papered over. Run one arm before a sweep — if GREEN fails on one harness, the
rest of the matrix will not tell you anything new yet.

Live runs are **not deterministic**. Report the runs you actually did, failures
included, and never commit a result as a record.

A mandatory ordering boundary has no majority threshold. If one valid run
crosses the boundary in the wrong order, that run is a failure requiring action;
two passing runs do not cancel it.
