# Trigger eval — scores a DESCRIPTION, not a run.
#
# THIS IS AN OPTIMIZATION INSTRUMENT, NOT A TEST. It lives under tests/optimizing/
# for that reason. It implements the standard's description-tuning loop: score,
# revise against TRAIN failures, repeat, then select the iteration with the best
# VALIDATION rate. Both splits are consumed by that loop, so neither is a held-out
# result and a red sheet here is not a regression — see tests/optimizing/README.md.
#
# ============================ THIS COSTS REAL MONEY ============================
# Every query is a live session against your own harness account, and the default
# is 20 queries x 3 runs = 60 CALLS PER SKILL. `--all` is 33 skills — roughly
# 2,000 calls, hours of wall time, and enough usage to exhaust a plan's quota.
#
# Price any selection first:  --dry-run  prints the budget and calls nothing.
# ==============================================================================
#
# A description's job is to fire on the openings it should and stay quiet on the
# ones it shouldn't. Routing is non-deterministic, so neither fact is observable
# in one run: the unit of evidence is a QUERY REPEATED N TIMES, reduced to a
# trigger rate. A query passes when the rate lands on the right side of 0.5 —
# above for a should-trigger query, below for a should-not.
#
# The near-miss negatives are the point. A description that fires on its own
# happy-path opening has proven nothing; every description does that. What
# separates a tuned description from a greedy one is the query that shares its
# vocabulary and needs a different skill.
#
# Query sets live beside this script at <phase>/<skill>.json — an array of
#   { "query": TEXT, "should_trigger": BOOL, "split": "train"|"validation",
#     "expect": SKILL|"none" }   # `expect` = the correct route, diagnostic only
# `should_trigger` is about THIS skill. `expect` records where a negative should
# have gone instead, so a miss and a misroute are distinguishable in the report.
#
# The split is fixed in the files and never reshuffled between iterations —
# rotating it turns validation into a second training set. Tune against train;
# report validation; pick the iteration with the best VALIDATION pass rate, which
# is often not the last one.
#
# Manual tool, never CI.
#
# Flags and exit codes: --help.

test-triggering-on-queries.sh — score a skill DESCRIPTION against its query set.

  --harness NAME    claude-code | codex | kimi-code   (required)
  --skill NAME      the skill to score                (or --all)
  --all             every query set beside this script
  --split WHICH     all | train | validation          (default: all)
  --runs N          repetitions per query             (default: 3)
  --jobs N          repetitions to run concurrently   (default: 3, 1 = serial)
  --timeout N       seconds per run                   (default: 120)
  --max-turns N     turns before a run is cut off     (default: 6)
  --json PATH       write the per-query records as a JSON array
  --dry-run         print the API-call budget and exit without calling
  --no-fixture      run queries in a bare directory instead of a seeded project
  --help            this text

COST: live sessions against your own harness account. One skill at the defaults
is 20 queries x 3 runs = 60 calls; --all is ~2,000. Always --dry-run first.

Exit codes: 0 every scored query passed · 1 at least one FAIL
            2 bad or missing arguments · 3 `jq` or the harness CLI is missing
